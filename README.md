# Coronavirus Tracker
This project displays the cases per county in the United States, the total number of cases to that date in each county, and new cases in each county. Additionally, at the top, there is a count for the total number of cases in the United States and new cases reported in the last day. When the project is deployed to elasticbeanstalk, the webapp should refresh with new data every day.
# Motivation
My motivation behind this project was to both explore new technologies and refresh old ones. The new technologies I learned were the Spring Boot framework as well as Bootstrap for the front end. My plan is to eventually add data visualizations and other front end niceties. The older technologies I revisited were Java and HTML. I was mostly interested in getting more hands on Java experience as I only have done a couple of projects in Java through school.
